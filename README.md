# 3D Virtual Environment

For a project in my master studies I had to create a 3D virtual communication environment with JavaScript that runs in the browser. The rooms were designed and created with blender, back-end implemented with Node.js, and the front-end with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The 3D scene was rendered using the 3D graph library rendeer.js which can be found [here](https://github.com/jagenjo/rendeer.js).

The result looks like [this](https://youtu.be/3ykdngrXfb8) (youtube video):
